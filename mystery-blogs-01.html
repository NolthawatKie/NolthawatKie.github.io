                    1. When I start (looking for) another new job <br> while Ex-job I started for only 3 months

                Let' start with the point. I was in charge in PL/SQL Developer for 2.5 months,working with the largest one database
                `Oracle`, but here's the big one problem for me, somebody knows about working with Oracle database somebody doesn't no
                (included me) because there're neither resource for free nor low budget to self learn. (I graduated in Engineer learning
                about statistic 555+). I guess people in some faculty feels familiar about Oracle but I didn't like it then I quited
                from this job though worked only 2.5 months. <br><br>
                
                But I want to hob in software or data-driven company (cliche word 555+) then I keep this company that I worked for only
                3 months and this job role in the resume and post it in Linkedin, Jobsdb. And note that "I'm interested in Data Analyst,
                Data Engineer, ..." with no wording about PL/SQL ( count = 0 ) <br><br>

                3 calls per week in average I got that offer PL/SQL roles in the big company with required 1-3 year experience. Yes more
                than 1 year exp. but I have < 1 year exp and in the resume I don't interested in this role. Wtf !!! the IT recruiter you
                never read that f*cking resume I wrote. You just read my experience with the key word just only the key word you
                read Huh? you didn't skim or scan or whatever you should do before you call me  <br><br>
                
                Waste that time both you (the
                recruiter) and me.  <br> The time is precious you know ???
